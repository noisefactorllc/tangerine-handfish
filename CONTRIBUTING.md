# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in tangerine-handfish!

## Build Prerequisites

This project's standalone build inlines design tokens from the [Handfish](https://github.com/noisedeck/handfish) repo. Clone it as a sibling directory:

```
parent/
├── handfish/              # git clone https://github.com/noisedeck/handfish
└── tangerine-handfish/    # this repo
```

The **modular** build (`npm run build`) does not require the Handfish repo — it outputs CSS that expects Handfish tokens loaded separately.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build              # modular (no handfish repo needed)
npm run build:standalone   # standalone (requires ../handfish/)
npm run build:all          # all theme variants
```
